How do we define a "mass shooting"?
Some sources define mass shootings as incidents in which three or more victims were shot and killed, not including the perpetrator, while others use a threshold of four or more killed. Some sources define a mass shooting as any incident in which four or more people were shot or injured. Some sources include domestic violence, gang conflict, drug trade disputes, or robberies in their numbers, whereas others focus on more indiscriminate mass public shootings. We follow the Congressional Research Service definition of a mass public shooting, as follows:
“…a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms—not including the offender(s)—within one event, and at least some of the murders occurred in a public location or locations in close geographical proximity (e.g., a workplace, school, restaurant, or other public settings), and the murders are not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance (armed robbery, criminal competition, insurance fraud, argument, or romantic triangle).”
We acknowledge the limits of this definition. Every shooting is a tragedy and many factors influence whether a threshold of four or more people killed in public is reached. However, this database was built specifically to understand the psychosocial histories of mass public shooters (the who, what, where, when, why, and how) in depth in an effort to inform prevention and intervention efforts for this exact crime. We start with the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting not because this was the first mass public shooting, but because it was the first modern mass public shooting—it unfolded live on radio and television and mass shootings since have received sufficient news coverage to be able to reconstruct and study them.

What data sources and methods did we use?
This project followed a research methodology that has proven effective in terrorism studies, which also are rare events that can result in mass casualties. The database was constructed using public records and open-source data. Where available and applicable, we drew on first person accounts, such as the perpetrators’ diaries, “manifestos,” suicide notes, social media and blog posts, audio and video recordings, interview transcripts, and personal correspondence. We also used secondary sources such as existing mass shooter databases, media coverage, documentary films and podcasts, biographies, monographs and academic journal articles, court transcripts, federal, state, and local law enforcement records, medical records, school records, and autopsy reports. Anything that could be requested or found on the internet was included. The community database only goes back to 1995 and draws on U.S. Census data for the closest census year, FBI Uniform Crime Reports, Google Maps, and other macro-level data sources.

Any coding is a subjective and interpretive process. Informed by existing datasets, the research literature, and frequently asked questions about mass shooters, the Principal Investigators generated a list of variables to be coded and created a codebook to define and detail how to code them. The codebook was then piloted on a small random sample of test cases and refined based on user-experience.

Once the codebook was finalized and coders were trained in its use, the database was populated as follows:

1.  Each mass shooter meeting the inclusion criteria (see definition above) was investigated twice by two separate coders, working independently from each other.
2.  The two resulting datasets were then merged and compared.
3.  Any discrepancies were flagged and reconciled by consensus of the Principal Investigators, who did their own fact-checking and weighed the quality and quantity of the evidence, typically giving precedence to primary source material.
4.  The database was then divided up among the original coders and independently checked again.
5.  Finally, the Database Manager conducted a full and final check, scrutinizing each and every cell.
6.  The Principal Investigators answered any queries resulting from the final check before approving publication.

We have taken every step possible to find and verify sources and to rigorously fact-check the data, but the end result is not perfect. Data privacy laws (rightly) limit full access to official records. The source data were originally gathered for purposes different from our own. Media outlets have their own agendas and biases. Some cases are well reported on, others not so much, resulting in missing data. We also know more about recent cases and cases that go to trial (because the shooter survived). For these reasons, users should interpret trends over time with caution.
Likewise, there is a low base rate of mass shooters and mass shootings are extreme and rare events—discrete occurrences of infrequently observed phenomena. For this reason, we caution against using the data for predictive modeling and/or cherry-picking one variable at a time to tell a particular story. This is purposive sample and we present no comparison group. Comparisons are important. For example, 98% of mass shooters are men, but then 90% of all homicide offenders are men. The majority of mass shooters are white, but the racial composition of the sample is comparable to the demographics of the U.S. population overall. Many of the factors correlated with mass shootings in the database are true of millions of people who never commit mass shootings.

Will we update the database?
Yes. New variables are added and the data are updated if new information becomes available. If you spot a mistake, please tell us so we can correct it. The data are current up to May 2022.

Classification (A handgun has a short barrel; a shotgun has a long barrel and usually has a smooth bore; a rifle has a long barrel with rifling, which puts spin on the bullet, increasing accuracy and distance; an assault weapon is any semi-automatic gun that can accept a detachable ammunition magazine that has one or more additional features considered useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary for sports or self-defense, such as a folding, telescoping or thumbhole rifle stock.
