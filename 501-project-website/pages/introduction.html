            <p>
                The issue of school shootings in the United States that has become
                impossible to ignore. Regardless of one's political views on gun
                control, nearly all Americans can agree that school shootings are
                a problem that must be solved.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project aims to take a closer look at the data behind school shootings
                in the United States with the goal of understanding the phenomenon at
                a deeper level. There has been much research performed [insert footnotes]
                in favor of both tightening and loosening legislature surrounding gun
                control. My project will not contribute to either side of this research,
                and will not address any matter related to gun control policies. Rather,
                my project will seek to identify other possible factors that contribute
                to the occurrence of a school shooting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of questions I will pursue answers to in my project include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Is there any correlation between the frequency or severity of school
                    shootings and a school's racial demographics? Do shootings at
                    predominantly white schools attract more media attention?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there any correlation between the frequency or severity of school
                    shootings and the economic status of the school's location?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there any correlation between the frequency or severity of school
                    shootings and a school's educational success/rating (either according
                    to traditional metrics such as test scores or more progressive metrics)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there any evidence to suggest that school shootings rise in frequency
                    or severity following school shootings that receive extensive media
                    attention? (for example, Columbine, Sandy Hook, Uvalde)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there any correlation between the frequency or severity of school
                    shootings and the weather patterns associated with the location of the
                    school?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have school shootings become more or less frequent since the COVID-19
                    pandemic?
                </li>
            </ol>
