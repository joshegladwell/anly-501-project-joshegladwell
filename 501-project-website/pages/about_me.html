        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div>
            <p>I am from Sacramento, CA, and I attended Brigham Young University as
            an undergraduate majoring in Statistics (with an emphasis in data
            science) and Russian. I chose Russian as one of my majors because I
            lived in Ukraine for two years as a church missionary immediately
            following high school. I learned Russian during that time by speaking
            with strangers on a daily basis, which led to my deep love for the
            language and culture of that region of the world. Someday I hope to
            learn Ukrainian as well!</p>
            <p>My interest in data science started during my undergrad when I
            attended a university forum featuring Dr. DJ Patil–the former United
            States Chief Data Scientist under the Obama Administration. His remarks
            on the power of data to solve social problems in the world inspired me
            to pursue a career in data science. I am especially interested in this
            application of data science–addressing social problems through data.</p>
            <p>Aside from my academic interests, I love watching movies (especially
            Star Wars), collecting posters and LEGOs, going on runs, and
            reading.</p>
